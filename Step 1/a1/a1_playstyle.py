"""
The Playstyle classes for A1.
Docstring examples are not required for Playstyles.

The Playstyle classes represent ways for us to choose attacks. 
They are initialized with 2 attibutes: whether they're a Manual mode or not, 
and the battle queue for it. When it's called to perform an action, it'll try 
to decide an action for the first person in that BattleQueue.

The Manual Playstyle has been provided for you.
It simply takes the key that is pressed and calls perform_action, passing in
that key if it's a valid key ("A" or "S").

You are tasked with implementing the Random Playstyle, which returns a key 
for a move that can be used by the player (e.g. if the character has enough SP 
for only a normal attack, it should return 'A'. If they have enough SP for 
either a normal or a special attack, it should return either 'A' or 
'S') at random.
