"""
Basic Unittests for your implementation of a mage for A1.

Passing these tests ensures that our test scripts can run on your code, and will
determine a portion of your mark (see Grading Scheme).

Passing these tests does NOT mean your code is flawless. These tests just
check for all of the basic functionality, without searching too deeply for logic
errors.

Try playing your game through multiple times and trying various combinations of
actions.
